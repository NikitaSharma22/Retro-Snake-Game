### Guilt That Doesn’t Come From Doing Wrong  

Guilt can be confusing. Sometimes, it’s not about doing something wrong but about feeling like you’re not doing enough. It’s that quiet thought in your mind asking, **Am I giving back as much as I should?** Even when you’re trying your best, it can feel like you’re not balancing things the right way.  

You care deeply, and you want to help. But at the same time, there’s a part of you that wants to focus on your own work and goals. That’s when the guilt shows up—making you wonder if it’s selfish to think about yourself while also trying to give your time and energy to someone else.  

This kind of guilt is hard to carry because it comes from love and responsibility. You’re doing what you can, but it still feels like it’s not enough. Even though no one’s keeping score, you can’t stop feeling like you owe more than you’re giving.  

It’s a tough feeling to deal with. You love helping, but you also feel torn because you want to do more for yourself too. Finding that balance feels impossible, and the guilt keeps reminding you of everything you think you should be doing.
