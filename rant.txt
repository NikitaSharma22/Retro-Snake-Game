See, i live in India and  got 72% in 12th grade in science stream, i wanted to get into iit, but because of my less percentage, i have to give 12th exam again and score good in jee, but after 3-4 months of taking coaching (i took a drop year), i realised iit is not for me, the physics, chemistry, maths don't interest me, i told my uncle who was guiding me this whole time, he was very supportive, and said to do what i like, it has been 100 days since that talk and i have been writing blogs, writing codes, yk my coding ventures, insta-yt account. But the thing is my parents dont know about this, that i am not preparing for the entrance exam, so we (me and uncle) have to tell them something, and now my uncle asked me what do you think of your future, and i am blank because ik the answer is important but idk what to answer. I like coding and want to study college from here, Chennai, where Mama lives but idk i dont wanna burden anyone.
